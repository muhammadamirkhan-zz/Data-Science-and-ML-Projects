## Overview
> This project focused on building a language classifier for 03 languages. Starting with cleaning and preprocessing the data for language classification.Then learning some theory behind Naive Bayes Modeling, and the impact that class imbalance of training data has on classification performance, followed by learning about how to use subword units to further mitigate the negative effects of class imbalance, and build an even better model.
## Key Tasks
* Exploratory data analysis of raw data, as well as some basic visualization
* Data cleaning and preprocessing relevant for task
* Theory behind and training of a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model
* Making adjustments to model to take into account class imbalance using theory behind Naive Bayes
* Using subword units to further counteract class imbalance and improve model performanc

## Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
Just clone the repo and simply run the notebook.
