## Overview
> This project is basically a binary classification web app. The project classifies mushrooms into either edible or poisnuous class.The project is based on a web app built using python's streamlit library. With a user-friendly interface, it enables users to select an algotirhm and then accordingly set it's hyperparamteres and then just hit the classify button to run the classification on data 
## Key Tasks
* Project Overview and Demo
* Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps
* Load the Mushrooms Data Set
* Creating Training and Test Sets
* Plot Evaluation Metrics
* Training a Support Vector Classifier
* Training a Support Vector Classifier (Part 2)
* Train a Logistic Regression Classifier
* Training a Random Forest Classifier

## Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
Just clone the repo and simply run the notebook. Please note that keep dataset and notebook in same directory or change to the dataset accordingly.
